Dear Zachary Streetsinger

My name is Kushchenko Sergey. I’m 37 years old. I’m IT guy.
I'm from Max.

My English level is Intermidiate B1 according to the site efset.org.

I'm thinking about relocating for work.
This is the main reason for improving my language skill.

The other reason is the strong desire to speak and understand English language.

I'd like you to teach me English.

Yours sincerely,
  Sergey
